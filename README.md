# Freon DSLs

This repository contains a couple of DSLs implemented with [Freon](https://www.freon4dsl.dev/) - also see [its GitHub org](https://github.com/freon4dsl/).

The purpose of these DSL implementations is to serve as examples, and are provided as-is (without guarantee and/or support) under the Apache 2.0 License.

The implementations are derived from the [Freon template](https://github.com/freon4dsl/Freon-template).

Freon was recently renamed from “ProjectIt”, and some implementations might not be switched over completely.
